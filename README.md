# SnapCalculator
How much money did you spend for Snapp! ?

## How does it work?
actully it is not a GUI application :)) but it will do the best for you ;)! this code works with Selenium (module that uses Webscrape system). If you do not know what is WebScraping? it's a browser RoBot based. When you run the code, browser will pop up and do the job all automatically. What are you waiting for? let's go!!!!!!!

## Attention!
In one section of this code, you have to enter a verification code from your mobile phone manually! because we can't access to our phone to read that damn verification code :D. so, forgive me.

## Requirements :

Everybody love this section, because we should know that what things we need, to run this tiny code! In order to use this code, these modules needs to be installed on your operating system.


* `selenium`

* `pandas`

* `time`

And thats it!

## Run :

to run code use the command below in your terminal :

```Python
python3 Snapp.py
```

Hope u enjoy!
